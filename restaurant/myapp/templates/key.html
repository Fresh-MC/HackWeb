            <h1>Eco Friendly Packaging</h1>
            <p>Sustainable packaging is made from materials like recyclable PET or HDPE plastics, cardboard,
               and paper, which can be reprocessed into new items. It also includes compostable materials 
               such as PLA (starch-based) and cellulose, which biodegrade in compost, offering an eco-friendly 
               alternative to traditional plastics.</p>
